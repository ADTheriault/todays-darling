2026-02-02 12:58:08 [INFO] Summary: The essay explores the unsettling experience of discovering a newspaper in an unexpected place with no memory of putting it there, contrasting the frightening loss of control in sleepwalking with the peaceful erasure of time under anesthesia, ultimately revealing it was caused by a sleeping pill.

2026-02-03 06:07:08 [INFO] Translated title: My eyes are sleepy. The movie "Fabrication."
2026-02-03 06:07:08 [INFO] Summary: The essay humorously chronicles how the author's plan to write about something "inconsequential" is derailed by sleepy eyes and staying up late to watch an intense movie about fabricated accusations, demonstrating how minor decisions (like "just resting your eyes" or "just starting a movie") can spiral beyond our control.

2026-02-04 05:39:09 [INFO] Translated title: There is such a thing as "the heart," isn't there.
2026-02-04 05:39:09 [INFO] Summary: This essay reflects on the elusive nature of the "heart" or inner self—something we can't physically locate or prove exists, yet which reveals itself through all our actions, expressions, and human exchanges. The author concludes by questioning what will become of this invisible but essential human quality in an age of advancing artificial intelligence.
