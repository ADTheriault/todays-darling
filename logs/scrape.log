2026-02-02 12:58:08 [INFO] Translated title: Why is the morning paper here?!
2026-02-02 12:58:08 [INFO] Summary: The essay explores the unsettling experience of discovering a newspaper in an unexpected place with no memory of putting it there, contrasting the frightening loss of control in sleepwalking with the peaceful erasure of time under anesthesia, ultimately revealing it was caused by a sleeping pill.

2026-02-03 06:07:08 [INFO] Translated title: My eyes are sleepy. The movie "Fabrication."
2026-02-03 06:07:08 [INFO] Summary: The essay humorously chronicles how the author's plan to write about something "inconsequential" is derailed by sleepy eyes and staying up late to watch an intense movie about fabricated accusations, demonstrating how minor decisions (like "just resting your eyes" or "just starting a movie") can spiral beyond our control.

2026-02-04 05:39:09 [INFO] Translated title: There is such a thing as "the heart," isn't there.
2026-02-04 05:39:09 [INFO] Summary: This essay reflects on the elusive nature of the "heart" or inner self—something we can't physically locate or prove exists, yet which reveals itself through all our actions, expressions, and human exchanges. The author concludes by questioning what will become of this invisible but essential human quality in an age of advancing artificial intelligence.

2026-02-05 06:12:52 [INFO] Translated title: Even the present will eventually become the past.
2026-02-05 06:12:52 [INFO] Summary: The essay argues that while nostalgia for "the old days" is natural, every era has felt troubled to those living through it, so adults have a responsibility to find hope in the present and future rather than teaching children that everything is only getting worse.

2026-02-06 06:09:21 [INFO] Summary: The essay explores how we mindlessly treat names and words as mere labels without considering their literal meanings or the intentions behind them, though the author acknowledges that constantly questioning everything would be exhausting and annoying.

2026-02-07 05:32:24 [INFO] Summary: The essay argues that regardless of your opinions or purposes, you should never mock people who are simply doing their best at harmless things—even if you don't like or respect them, basic human dignity requires refraining from ridicule.

2026-02-08 06:08:16 [INFO] Summary: While people may occasionally respond to orders, they are fundamentally motivated by their own desires, beliefs, relationships, fears, and values rather than by commands from others. Understanding what truly drives human action—whether in ourselves or others—is essential for creating better environments and relationships.

2026-02-09 06:48:06 [INFO] Summary: The essay uses the vastness of Earth's history as an analogy to argue that despite containing hundreds of millions of words across all languages, human vocabulary can only capture a tiny fraction of actual reality, revealing the fundamental limitations of language itself.
