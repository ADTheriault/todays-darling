## About

Shigesato Itoi publishes a daily essay called "Today's Darling" (今日のダーリン) on Hobonichi's website. These essays are ephemeral and disappear after a short time.

This project automatically scrapes each day's essay, translates it to English using Claude, and archives it in an Atom feed for RSS readers.
