It really is true that "to be alive is to make memories." As long as you're living, you can make memories. To put it the other way around, it sounds rather blunt, but "if you're not alive, you can't make memories." Of course, not all memories are pleasant ones.

People talk about the follies of youth, or how being young means being foolish, and especially when it comes to memories from our younger days, there are things that would be impossible for us now. Some people might say, "That doesn't apply to me," but for me, it does. I don't know if I have many or few, but there are embarrassing things. If the person I was back then were standing in front of me now, there are things I'd want to sit him down and lecture him about at length. But I suspect that even if the present me tried to reason with him, the me of those days wouldn't understand.

The things you do while even slightly thinking "this is wrong," since that feeling is there from the start, you can put the brakes on. Or even when you're just "getting carried away," since deep down you have some awareness of it, even if you're rebellious for a while, it'll settle down eventually. If there was a fundamentally mistaken idea, and both society and yourself were steeped in that mistake, then those are the kinds of things you might reconsider.

What's more troubling is when you're convinced that you're thinking the right thing, that you're doing the right thing, and you look down on people who aren't, or attack people whose ideas don't align with yours. Since you're right, anyone who gets in your way must be either bad or backward, you decide. While you're alive, whether you like it or not, you make memories like that too. It's better not to forget those kinds of memories. Depending on how the lines twist in a simple lottery game, just about any possibility exists. You need to know that. Because to be alive is, well, to have memories piling up.

Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. I hope there's plenty of blank space between one memory and the next.
