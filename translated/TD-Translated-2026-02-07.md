No matter how right your ideas might be, no matter how noble your purpose, you mustn't make fun of people who are doing their best at something that isn't hurting anyone.

Every day, eating their meals, drinking water, getting their teeth brushed a little, pawing at their bedding to make it just right before lying down to sleep. We love that dog.

Heading off to school with their backpack, listening to the teacher's lessons with a mix of earnestness and boredom, eating lunch, playing, and coming home again. We adore that elementary school kid.

Laughing at something, crying over something, sometimes getting angry about something, rooting for something, quietly absorbed in their work. We help each other out, all of us.

Completely aged now, more wrinkles too, complaining about this ache or that itch, no longer particularly lovely or cool. Sometimes I look at my parent and think, they're just like me.

Whether someone is somebody or nobody, whether they're good at their job or not, whether they're deep in thought or spacing out, it's nobody's business to criticize.

Everyone on the train, everyone waiting at the traffic light, even, for that matter, everyone who dislikes me. You still mustn't make fun of them.

I'm not saying you have to like them, but first of all, you mustn't make fun of them.

Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. Even if you can't manage admiration or respect, you mustn't make fun of people.
