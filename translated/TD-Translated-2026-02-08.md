People don't move because of orders. Now, someone might say, "No, they do move when ordered," and sure, I know that happens. There was even a time when society as a whole operated more on orders. In old dramas, you'd often see scenes where someone would ask, "Is that an order?" and get the reply, "Yes, this is an order." In other words, scenes depicting a kind of "military discipline" where you obey an order even when it goes against your will. Such situations haven't disappeared entirely. But they've decreased tremendously. Fundamentally, truly, people don't move because of orders. It's better to think that way. Whether it's about yourself or about others, I think believing that "people don't move because of orders" helps create a better environment.

If orders don't move people, what does? There's no single answer. People move for things they like. If there's something they want, they move for that. They'll move for something they believe in or someone they love. They'll move for their own sense of virtue or ethics. Things like that. And beyond that, while not orders exactly, people might move because of violence. They move because everyone else is doing it, swept along by the current. Whether directly or indirectly, they move when threatened. They move to escape from something. They move quite readily out of competitive spirit with others. They might even move under something like hypnosis. And so on. There are really all kinds of reasons people move. Why do I move? When do I try to move? What do I move for? People don't move because of orders, but what does make them move? It's not a quiz, but it's worth thinking about.

Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. It's a Sunday with all sorts of things going on: a cold wave, elections, and the Olympics.
