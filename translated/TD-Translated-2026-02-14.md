The "Hobonichi Manga Club" has finally been announced. We decided to start by putting out a call for members. I've also been telling various people individually, here and there, "We're starting this new thing." Each person had their own response, and reading them was a pleasure. What I appreciated most was that no one asked those press conference-style questions like "What exactly are you going to do?" We've created this new space within Hobonichi and talked plenty about the Manga Club, but we haven't written anything about what kind of business this will be. First, we're gathering members for the Manga Club. That comes before anything else. Everyone gets that.

You don't know what you'll find on an expedition, that's why it's an expedition. When the expedition team sets out, that's when the expedition begins. These are the kinds of thoughts I'm having now.

"Already knowing too much" is the worst thing. Researching too much, thinking too much, asking too much, covering all the bases, I've been careful about all of that as we've moved forward with the Hobonichi Manga Club. Who wants to do something where everything is already anticipated? We're not looking to be praised for being clever.

From the very first day, we've gotten a flood of applications, not just from my friends and acquaintances, but from people who visit Hobonichi. How interesting this is, how exciting. When we started Hobonichi, there was nothing else like it, and this feels similar somehow. Still, the thrill of a new beginning, that pounding in your chest, depending on how you experience it, can feel more like an ache. No matter how old you get, there's that tension like standing under a waterfall. Well, this is what keeps everyone going, you know. I'm putting on a brave face here, but honestly, we're moving forward while holding on to our weaknesses and our foolishness too.

Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. There's actually something joyful about saying, this is who we are right now, nothing more, nothing less.
