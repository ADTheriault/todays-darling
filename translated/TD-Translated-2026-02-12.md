These days, whenever I see a four-digit number starting with 1, I can't help wanting to divide it by 360. Who knew the Olympics would affect me in such a strange way.

Numbers don't actually exist, you know. I mean, I sound like a drunk person rambling, but while there are three apples or five bananas, there's no such thing as "3" or "5" itself. They're just concepts we've agreed to treat as real. Numbers can be generated endlessly, you can add and subtract and multiply and divide them, process them however you like. They're useful concepts in all sorts of ways, but because people have been using them for so long, they've taken on all kinds of personalities.

7777, or 3333, or 1111, these are like the rock stars of the number world. Change just one digit to 7776 and suddenly it's not a star anymore. Numbers like 9837 or 5746 or 3895 or 7658 might seem ordinary and unremarkable, but really they're the same as 7777 or 3333 or 1111. Even numbers like 2983 or 1187, if you give them a reading like "meat shop" or "good flowers," they may look plain but they get assigned a role. Well, 1101 is dressed up in the costume of "Itoi" too.

But you know, it's not just numbers. There are supposedly 8.2 or 8.3 billion people in the world, but fundamentally speaking, we're all the same if you think about it. Though you could also say we're all different. But as "humans," the materials we're made of, the way we're made, it's all the same. Maybe it's the way we're raised, the way we live, that isn't the same. There are people like 777777, and people like 33333333, but basically everyone starts out as just a simple 1, and when we die we all become indistinguishable bones anyway. 8.3 billion versions of "me," each one the same "human being."

Thanks for coming to Hobonichi again today. Sorry, thinking about stuff like this has kind of become a hobby of mine lately.
