Yesterday I did something unusual: I ended my piece in a way that clearly signaled, "I'll continue this tomorrow." (First, let me recap what I wrote yesterday.)

There was an era when people wrote in classical literary style, but this became too restrictive for expressing various things, so a new style emerged called genbun'itchi, which incorporated spoken language and moved closer to everyday reality. Then, once genbun'itchi became standard, a copywriter named Tsuchiya Koichi half-jokingly coined the term genbun'issho. My guess is that this style probably came from television commercial narration scripts. Because it's closer than anything to the language of everyday life, you could say it's accessible and easy to read for anyone. It's also easier to convey what you want to say, and easier for people to understand. But either way, these are all matters of literary style. In other words, people who aren't particularly interested in writing or reading don't want to read any of it. There are plenty of people for whom using language as a tool to represent the world just doesn't suit them. And besides, what can be expressed through language is, at the end of the day, only a fraction of the world.

(Now for a sudden turn.) But people who don't want to read books or essays will read manga, will watch anime, and will dive to considerable depths with those forms of expression. Even in page-turning, panel-by-panel manga, there are words written. There are quite long passages, and they say complex things. "But you'll read that," I think, finding it curious.

While I'm thinking about how language has changed, from classical style to genbun'itchi, from written language to spoken language, it's as if manga has been passing by on a parallel track. Academic papers written in words, poetry, even "silence"! Couldn't all of these be expressed through manga? Even if it's difficult for an individual, you could form a team like in film production. (Not that I'm positioning this against written work.) The tremendous expressive possibilities of manga still have so much room to expand. I want to think about "methods" that don't remain within "pure language" alone.

Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. Though here I am writing about all this in "words" again today.
