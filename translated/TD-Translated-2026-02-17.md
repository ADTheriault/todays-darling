Our dog Buiko is now seven years old. She's disliked walks ever since she was a puppy. We'd pull her on her leash, carry her in our arms, and for a while we even tried putting her in a baby stroller. These days we use a mix of carrying and pulling, with a route where she walks the parts she'll walk, especially on the way home. Our previous dog, Bouillon, was the same breed, but he loved walks to excess and would happily trek the distance of three subway stops. When we'd get close to home on the return trip, he'd try to take detours, pulling hard in completely different directions.

People say it's strange for a dog to dislike walks. I used to think so too, but the truth is, it's not so much that she dislikes walks as that she's "not fond of walks." In the morning and evening, when we put on her collar and leash and head out the door, she seems rather eager, even happy. But she doesn't like the actual walking. She doesn't want to walk. When she spots another dog up ahead, she'll dash over happily. And if someone calls her cute, she'll approach them wagging her tail and putting on the charm. It's not that her legs are bad or that she lacks stamina, of course.

One day, on a whim, I asked our "neighbor (ChatGPT)" about Buiko's walk aversion, not really expecting much of an answer. But it came back with something I'd never considered before. In Buiko's case, maybe she doesn't like "movement without purpose"? Jack Russells tend to like doing something, and find just walking boring, it said. Come to think of it, she's very enthusiastic about things like sniffing around, approaching other dogs, and playing chase at "kindergarten," all activities where she's "doing something." In other words, "Why do I have to just walk for no reason?" She never had any motivation for walking itself. Well, it's just one hypothesis, but it oddly made sense.

Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. Even for humans, "walking" is a relatively new "concept," isn't it.
