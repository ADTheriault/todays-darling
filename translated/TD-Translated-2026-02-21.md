It feels strange to even say it out loud, but there's never any good news to be found. Maybe a little bit when it comes to sports, maybe a tiny bit. But day after day, all that gets reported is bad news. Domestic and foreign, past, present, and future, as we all know too well. And yet I feel I need to know more about these troubling stories, these grim realities, so I end up studying all kinds of bad news. There are mountains of things I can't do anything about, and occasionally something where I might be able to help a little. But the things I can't do anything about far outnumber the rest. If I try to maintain some informed perspective even on the things I can't change, the time and energy spent thinking about them only increases. If you conscientiously engage with all the bad news, you risk becoming someone who spends most of their life thinking about bad news, worrying about it. Some people have spent their entire lives worrying, from birth to death, worrying about everything. I actually think there are people living like that. People might laugh and say, "Surely not you?" but if I'm not careful, I could easily become that kind of person myself. No really, it's true. To varying degrees, we're all at risk.

Why are we able to live through today and tomorrow in a world full of such terrible things? I wonder about this sometimes, but I think it's probably because even when the world is drowning in bad news, there are still moments of relief, heartening examples of human kindness, adorable people and creatures, beautiful things, scattered here and there like stepping stones. We still have time to hop from stone to stone, the ones that poke up above the dark waters of bad news. And maybe those stepping stones, even if their total surface area is small, keep stubbornly appearing, one after another. Perhaps that's what we believe. If everyone truly started believing that "human kindness doesn't exist anywhere," then human kindness really would have no place left to go.

Thank you for visiting Hobonichi today. I'm sure since ancient times, most of the news has always been bad.
