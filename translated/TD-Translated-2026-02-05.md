"Things were better in the old days." People tend to think this way. I'm one of those people, so I catch myself thinking it too. When I look back, there really were a lot of good things, weren't there? And maybe that's true, but those "old days" that are supposed to have been so good don't exist anymore. Even if remnants remain, the old days are gone precisely because they're now absent. All we can do is create "something like those good old days." Patching together or reheating whatever's left to make "something like those good old days" is expensive. Still, if everyone decides it's better to have it, or if enough people want it, then "something like the old days" can somehow be made. Being able to create something that people call "good" is certainly a fine thing, I think.

But isn't thinking "things were better in the old days" about everything just having too little expectation for "now"? It's true that every day, constantly, unwelcome news about the "now" comes flying at us. Plenty of people talk about how "now" is only getting worse. They say the current situation is more terrible than ever before, but when I really think about it, as far as I know, every era has always been described that way. Even if you pull out timelines of world history, there probably isn't a single era where people said "now is really great." So naturally, the "old days" that we somehow managed to get through start to seem like they were good. Of course, I have those feelings inside me too.

But you know, if that's how it is, then what about children who've only just been born recently? Are they supposed to live from a "now" with nothing good in it into a "future" that only gets worse? I don't think that's quite right either. We have to look carefully at the "now" that actually exists here and search for hope in the "future" ahead. As adults who've been alive since way back in the "old days," that's our job.

Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. May you have the good fortune of shelter from rain and wind and heat and cold, a full belly, and light.
