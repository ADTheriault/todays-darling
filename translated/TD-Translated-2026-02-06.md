Walking through Shibuya, I thought I saw the words "Mountain Gorilla." I kept walking without bothering to confirm, but it stayed on my mind. Was it a shop name? A brand? Either way, pretty much every naming possibility has been used up by now...

Then it occurred to me, as an afterthought, that "Mountain Gorilla" literally means "gorilla from the mountains." Which would mean there are gorillas that aren't from the mountains. So instead of mountains, they'd be from... the lowlands? "Lowland Gorilla"? Lowland... wait. Lowland, as in... "Lowland Gorilla"! I already knew that name.

I'd heard of Mountain Gorillas and Lowland Gorillas before, but I'd never actually thought about how those names indicated their habitat, or rather, their taxonomic classification. They were properly introducing themselves all along, "I'm a mountain gorilla," "I'm a lowland gorilla," and I just wasn't listening.

Come to think of it, the same goes for people's names. Parents pour their hopes and wishes into the names they give their children, but don't we all just ignore that? Whether it's Yoshiko or Kimi or Sho or Kenichi or Tetsu or Yasuhiro, people introduce themselves by their names. But the person hearing it doesn't really take it seriously, do they? They're not listening to the deep themes embedded in those names. They just treat "Yoshiko" or "Tetsu" like labels. But really, those names carry messages: "Beauty," "Philosophy."

And it's not just names. People really don't listen to things, do they? Maybe if we actually took everything seriously and thought about it all, our days would become unbearably full of questions. Like when you're about to have a snack and someone pipes up: "They call it shortcake, but short compared to what? Have you ever seen a long cake anywhere?" That kind of person gets annoying fast.

Though I have to say, I'm pretty much always thinking along those annoying lines myself. I just don't say it out loud.

Thanks for coming to Hobonichi today. If it's annoying people talking to each other, I guess there's no problem.
