      <title>The child as the "inner person" of the adult.</title>
      <link>https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/#7e3503cb09ea</link>
      <description>The essay suggests that everyone contains their younger self—particularly a middle schooler—at their core, and recognizing this "person inside" helps us see others (and ourselves) on equal, human terms beneath all the adult layers we've added.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's an internet slang term, "the person inside." I always thought it was a strangely apt way of putting things. I feel like you don't hear it as much anymore, but it suddenly occurred to me: the person inside an adult is a child. Adults are adults, sure, but there's also a child inside them, and while they adopt adult attitudes and ways of speaking, they're also trying to satisfy themselves as that child. I'm not saying this is good or bad. If you can sense that child "inside" yourself, if you can feel "oh, there they are," well, that probably means you're pretty adult after all. You don't want to make the child inside cry. But you also can't just let that child run wild. That's what I've been thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, I've made a habit, for quite some time now, of thinking of just about everyone as "that kid I saw in a middle school classroom." Whether it's some distinguished professor or a big star, every human being has gone through their middle school years. What kind of face did they make back then as a junior high kid? What did the other students think of them? How did they spend their time? Even without thinking too deeply about it, can't you kind of see it? Of course I'm sometimes right and sometimes wrong, but if you think of most people's true form as a middle schooler (and I'm just a middle schooler myself, after all), you can see them on incredibly level terms. Most of the time, I think, "Oh yeah, there was someone just like this!" I'm well aware that people attach and subtract various things from there to build up their personality or character or what have you. But no matter how much they pile on or exaggerate, the basis is usually "that kid I saw in the middle school classroom." And, though this feels like adding an unnecessary tail to the thought, there are also adults and old people as the person inside a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming to Hobonichi again today. The development of early childhood education and childcare is necessary for adults too.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Because we're alive, we have memories.</title>
      <link>https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/#f39111806c7f</link>
      <description>The essay reflects on how living means continuously creating memories, and warns that the most troubling mistakes come not from knowing we're wrong, but from being completely convinced we're right while judging or attacking others—memories we should remember as reminders of how easily any of us can fall into that trap.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really is true that "to be alive is to make memories." As long as you're living, you can make memories. To put it the other way around, it sounds rather blunt, but "if you're not alive, you can't make memories." Of course, not all memories are pleasant ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People talk about the follies of youth, or how being young means being foolish, and especially when it comes to memories from our younger days, there are things that would be impossible for us now. Some people might say, "That doesn't apply to me," but for me, it does. I don't know if I have many or few, but there are embarrassing things. If the person I was back then were standing in front of me now, there are things I'd want to sit him down and lecture him about at length. But I suspect that even if the present me tried to reason with him, the me of those days wouldn't understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things you do while even slightly thinking "this is wrong," since that feeling is there from the start, you can put the brakes on. Or even when you're just "getting carried away," since deep down you have some awareness of it, even if you're rebellious for a while, it'll settle down eventually. If there was a fundamentally mistaken idea, and both society and yourself were steeped in that mistake, then those are the kinds of things you might reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more troubling is when you're convinced that you're thinking the right thing, that you're doing the right thing, and you look down on people who aren't, or attack people whose ideas don't align with yours. Since you're right, anyone who gets in your way must be either bad or backward, you decide. While you're alive, whether you like it or not, you make memories like that too. It's better not to forget those kinds of memories. Depending on how the lines twist in a simple lottery game, just about any possibility exists. You need to know that. Because to be alive is, well, to have memories piling up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. I hope there's plenty of blank space between one memory and the next.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Most of the universe is something other than language.</title>
      <link>https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/#88252b94393f</link>
      <description>The essay uses the vastness of Earth's history as an analogy to argue that despite containing hundreds of millions of words across all languages, human vocabulary can only capture a tiny fraction of actual reality, revealing the fundamental limitations of language itself.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's this way of thinking about Earth's history: if you imagine it as a 24-hour clock, Homo sapiens, our human ancestors, don't appear until around 23:59:56. It's dizzying to think about, but we can't help picturing a timeline in our heads where the Nara period was long ago, the pyramids were built even further back, humanity emerged in some unimaginably distant past before that, and dinosaurs roamed in an even more remote antiquity. We imagine a timeline we can survey and comprehend. But really, "these things aren't even comparable!" We use poetic expressions like "as many as the stars," but the number of stars visible to the naked eye isn't actually all that many, is it? There's that saying, "The sands on the beach may run out, but thieves will never disappear from this world," which is meant to suggest an uncountable multitude. But if you think about it calmly, it doesn't seem like such a big deal. You could count the grains of sand on a beach if you really tried hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking along these lines for a while now, but recently I found myself wondering: how many words exist in the entire universe (or at least on Earth)? Not systematic "languages" like Japanese or Greek, but "vocabulary," all the individual words added up like grains of sand. I was playing around with this idea, consulting an AI. Even with the limited counting method of dictionary entries, each language has hundreds of thousands of words, and there are apparently around 7,000 languages, so we're talking tens of millions of words, maybe even 100 or 200 million, the AI told me. And since new words can be created at any time, the number is essentially infinite. It's very much an "aren't there so many!" kind of answer, even from the AI's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that Earth clock analogy made me realize something. However many hundreds of millions of words there might be, the total number of words that have existed since humans were born is nothing! (I'm channeling Kuroita Goro here.) The "actual things and phenomena" that haven't been turned into words, both artificial and natural, vastly outnumber the words themselves. Language, no matter how far it goes, can never reach "reality." It can only sketch a tiny portion with a limited set of paints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is just me playing with words too, I suppose. Thank you for visiting Hobonichi today. Don't be so proud, humanity. Don't be so proud, language.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Command.</title>
      <link>https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/#4bcd95c380a0</link>
      <description>While people may occasionally respond to orders, they are fundamentally motivated by their own desires, beliefs, relationships, fears, and values rather than by commands from others. Understanding what truly drives human action—whether in ourselves or others—is essential for creating better environments and relationships.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don't move because of orders. Now, someone might say, "No, they do move when ordered," and sure, I know that happens. There was even a time when society as a whole operated more on orders. In old dramas, you'd often see scenes where someone would ask, "Is that an order?" and get the reply, "Yes, this is an order." In other words, scenes depicting a kind of "military discipline" where you obey an order even when it goes against your will. Such situations haven't disappeared entirely. But they've decreased tremendously. Fundamentally, truly, people don't move because of orders. It's better to think that way. Whether it's about yourself or about others, I think believing that "people don't move because of orders" helps create a better environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If orders don't move people, what does? There's no single answer. People move for things they like. If there's something they want, they move for that. They'll move for something they believe in or someone they love. They'll move for their own sense of virtue or ethics. Things like that. And beyond that, while not orders exactly, people might move because of violence. They move because everyone else is doing it, swept along by the current. Whether directly or indirectly, they move when threatened. They move to escape from something. They move quite readily out of competitive spirit with others. They might even move under something like hypnosis. And so on. There are really all kinds of reasons people move. Why do I move? When do I try to move? What do I move for? People don't move because of orders, but what does make them move? It's not a quiz, but it's worth thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. It's a Sunday with all sorts of things going on: a cold wave, elections, and the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Don't make fun of me.</title>
      <link>https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/#60f74c3a1379</link>
      <description>The essay argues that regardless of your opinions or purposes, you should never mock people who are simply doing their best at harmless things—even if you don't like or respect them, basic human dignity requires refraining from ridicule.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how right your ideas might be, no matter how noble your purpose, you mustn't make fun of people who are doing their best at something that isn't hurting anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, eating their meals, drinking water, getting their teeth brushed a little, pawing at their bedding to make it just right before lying down to sleep. We love that dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading off to school with their backpack, listening to the teacher's lessons with a mix of earnestness and boredom, eating lunch, playing, and coming home again. We adore that elementary school kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laughing at something, crying over something, sometimes getting angry about something, rooting for something, quietly absorbed in their work. We help each other out, all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completely aged now, more wrinkles too, complaining about this ache or that itch, no longer particularly lovely or cool. Sometimes I look at my parent and think, they're just like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether someone is somebody or nobody, whether they're good at their job or not, whether they're deep in thought or spacing out, it's nobody's business to criticize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone on the train, everyone waiting at the traffic light, even, for that matter, everyone who dislikes me. You still mustn't make fun of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying you have to like them, but first of all, you mustn't make fun of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. Even if you can't manage admiration or respect, you mustn't make fun of people.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>People really aren't listening.</title>
      <link>https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/#e6e1591cbc1f</link>
      <description>The essay explores how we mindlessly treat names and words as mere labels without considering their literal meanings or the intentions behind them, though the author acknowledges that constantly questioning everything would be exhausting and annoying.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking through Shibuya, I thought I saw the words "Mountain Gorilla." I kept walking without bothering to confirm, but it stayed on my mind. Was it a shop name? A brand? Either way, pretty much every naming possibility has been used up by now...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to me, as an afterthought, that "Mountain Gorilla" literally means "gorilla from the mountains." Which would mean there are gorillas that aren't from the mountains. So instead of mountains, they'd be from... the lowlands? "Lowland Gorilla"? Lowland... wait. Lowland, as in... "Lowland Gorilla"! I already knew that name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd heard of Mountain Gorillas and Lowland Gorillas before, but I'd never actually thought about how those names indicated their habitat, or rather, their taxonomic classification. They were properly introducing themselves all along, "I'm a mountain gorilla," "I'm a lowland gorilla," and I just wasn't listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, the same goes for people's names. Parents pour their hopes and wishes into the names they give their children, but don't we all just ignore that? Whether it's Yoshiko or Kimi or Sho or Kenichi or Tetsu or Yasuhiro, people introduce themselves by their names. But the person hearing it doesn't really take it seriously, do they? They're not listening to the deep themes embedded in those names. They just treat "Yoshiko" or "Tetsu" like labels. But really, those names carry messages: "Beauty," "Philosophy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's not just names. People really don't listen to things, do they? Maybe if we actually took everything seriously and thought about it all, our days would become unbearably full of questions. Like when you're about to have a snack and someone pipes up: "They call it shortcake, but short compared to what? Have you ever seen a long cake anywhere?" That kind of person gets annoying fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I have to say, I'm pretty much always thinking along those annoying lines myself. I just don't say it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming to Hobonichi today. If it's annoying people talking to each other, I guess there's no problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Even the present will eventually become the past.</title>
      <link>https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/#bc6e838267b7</link>
      <description>The essay argues that while nostalgia for "the old days" is natural, every era has felt troubled to those living through it, so adults have a responsibility to find hope in the present and future rather than teaching children that everything is only getting worse.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things were better in the old days." People tend to think this way. I'm one of those people, so I catch myself thinking it too. When I look back, there really were a lot of good things, weren't there? And maybe that's true, but those "old days" that are supposed to have been so good don't exist anymore. Even if remnants remain, the old days are gone precisely because they're now absent. All we can do is create "something like those good old days." Patching together or reheating whatever's left to make "something like those good old days" is expensive. Still, if everyone decides it's better to have it, or if enough people want it, then "something like the old days" can somehow be made. Being able to create something that people call "good" is certainly a fine thing, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But isn't thinking "things were better in the old days" about everything just having too little expectation for "now"? It's true that every day, constantly, unwelcome news about the "now" comes flying at us. Plenty of people talk about how "now" is only getting worse. They say the current situation is more terrible than ever before, but when I really think about it, as far as I know, every era has always been described that way. Even if you pull out timelines of world history, there probably isn't a single era where people said "now is really great." So naturally, the "old days" that we somehow managed to get through start to seem like they were good. Of course, I have those feelings inside me too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know, if that's how it is, then what about children who've only just been born recently? Are they supposed to live from a "now" with nothing good in it into a "future" that only gets worse? I don't think that's quite right either. We have to look carefully at the "now" that actually exists here and search for hope in the "future" ahead. As adults who've been alive since way back in the "old days," that's our job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. May you have the good fortune of shelter from rain and wind and heat and cold, a full belly, and light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>There is such a thing as "the heart," isn't there.</title>
      <link>https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/#56f26886d49f</link>
      <description>This essay reflects on the elusive nature of the "heart" or inner self—something we can't physically locate or prove exists, yet which reveals itself through all our actions, expressions, and human exchanges. The author concludes by questioning what will become of this invisible but essential human quality in an age of advancing artificial intelligence.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a child, I've thought about it a little, or not thought about it at all, or thought about it seriously, or no wait, completely forgotten about it, or if I'm honest, held it very dear, or coldly dismissed it as something that might not even exist. I'm talking about the "heart," or the "mind," or whatever you want to call that thing inside us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you asked someone to show you where the heart is, they might place their hand over their chest, near the physical heart. Others would point to their head and say it's the brain inside the skull. But even if you pressed them further and asked if that's really where it is, they probably couldn't answer with any real confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our ordinary daily lives, we don't consciously think about the existence of air, yet air is there. In the same way, we live believing that the heart exists. To say that there's no such thing as the heart would, conversely, make everything impossible to explain. Because when a person dies, it's clear that their heart disappears too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we're alive, well, it's not quite "I think, therefore I am," but the heart is always thinking something. The heart is what wrote these lines I'm writing now, and it's your heart that has been reading them. I wrote them because I'm alive, and you read them because you're alive. An exchange of hearts happened here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can't show the heart itself, but we can show the traces of the heart's movements in all sorts of ways. Even a smiling face is a manifestation of the heart's movement. The words we speak, the words we write, paintings, calligraphy, dance, song, running, walking – all of these are expressions and traces of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, the act of writing, the act of dancing, the act of singing can set the heart in motion. There are things that wound the heart, and there must be things that invigorate it. Sometimes the heart wants to soak in a hot spring too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. Artificial intelligence keeps evolving, but what will happen to the heart?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>My eyes are sleepy. The movie "Fabrication."</title>
      <link>https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/#77385023838d</link>
      <description>The essay humorously chronicles how the author's plan to write about something "inconsequential" is derailed by sleepy eyes and staying up late to watch an intense movie about fabricated accusations, demonstrating how minor decisions (like "just resting your eyes" or "just starting a movie") can spiral beyond our control.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All right, time to write about something utterly inconsequential again today. That's what I think as I sit down at the keyboard, but I'm so sleepy. Though sleepiness comes in all different varieties, you know. I sometimes put it this way: rather than being sleepy overall, right now it's my "eyes that are sleepy." Being awake isn't hard, I'm full of energy to work! But since my "eyes are sleepy," I'd like to rest them if I could. To rest them, I figure I should close them. Maybe I'll close my eyes. It's only my eyes that are sleepy, after all. Just my eyes. If I'm going to close my eyes, it seems like it would be more convenient to lie down rather than stay sitting in this chair. I don't intend to sleep. I just want to close them to rest my eyes. That happens a lot, you know. And sometimes I actually do lie down on the sofa and close my eyes. Then, why is this? Even though I wasn't sleepy, I fall asleep. My "eyes were sleepy," that's all it was supposed to be, and yet I fall asleep. (Thus concludes this story for now. I was trying to write about something utterly inconsequential, but before I could write about something utterly inconsequential, I fell asleep.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my "eyes are still sleepy," and I think the reason is that last night, after I'd decided to go to bed, I started watching a movie. I started watching just the beginning of "Fabricated: The Man Called a Murderous Teacher," but I couldn't stop anywhere along the way and ended up watching the whole thing. I mean, the title itself is a "spoiler," isn't it? A film with an intense performance by Ayano Go, a fierce performance by Shibasaki Kou, and a superb supporting performance by Kobayashi Kaoru. The story of a man called a murderous teacher because of "fabrications." You practically know the whole plot without even watching it, don't you? But once I started watching, I became so frustrated, and got dragged into the quagmire along with the protagonist, and became so at a loss for what to do that I couldn't stop. But look, you know how it ends, right? He's able to clear his name. You want to see that outcome, even as you spend all that time feeling frustrated. It's a movie based on a true story, and honestly, it makes you grind your teeth. "Fabrications," when wielded by those with power, are terrifying, you know. Thanks for visiting Hobonichi today. That was me, all worked up at dawn, shouting things like "Yes, Kobayashi Kaoru!"&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Why is the morning paper here?!</title>

      <description>The essay explores the unsettling experience of discovering a newspaper in an unexpected place with no memory of putting it there, contrasting the frightening loss of control in sleepwalking with the peaceful erasure of time under anesthesia, ultimately revealing it was caused by a sleeping pill.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was too scared to tell anyone but my closest friends, but maybe it was last year? I was staying at a hotel, and when I got up late in the morning and went to the bathroom sink to brush my teeth, there was a newspaper sitting there. Huh? Did I put a newspaper here? I thought, and glanced at the front page to check the date. Today's news with today's date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, I just woke up. The newspaper gets delivered outside the door. So how did it get here? Did someone silently come into my room and leave the newspaper in the bathroom? A hotel wouldn't provide such intrusive service. Besides, I had the chain lock on, so no one could get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, did I do it myself? I have no idea what time the morning paper gets delivered to hotel doors, but the possibility that I did it myself was clearly higher than someone coming in. Does that mean I've lost the memory of doing it? Is this that "sleepwalking" thing you always used to see in old cartoons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe there have been times like this mixed into my life all along, these moments I have "no memory of." If there have been many times when I've done things but lived as though I hadn't, that's terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always loved general anesthesia. Time stops partway through "now you're going to sleep," and then I come back to myself with the words "oh, I'm awake." It's mysteriously delightful. During that stretch of time between those two moments, I alone am absent from the world. How fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sleepwalking is troubling and scary. Well, when I looked into it later after calming down, it turned out to be the effect of the sleeping pill I'd taken. Apparently I'd retrieved the newspaper while being led into sleep, and forgotten the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You hear about people who get drunk and lose their memory. I wonder if that's not scary for them because they know the cause?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. Anyway, since that time, I haven't had any more episodes of "no memory."&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
