    <title>It's not all bad things...</title>

Maybe a little bit when it comes to sports, maybe a tiny bit. But day after day, all that gets reported is bad news. Domestic and foreign, past, present, and future, as we all know too well. And yet I feel I need to know more about these troubling stories, these grim realities, so I end up studying all kinds of bad news. There are mountains of things I can't do anything about, and occasionally something where I might be able to help a little. But the things I can't do anything about far outnumber the rest. If I try to maintain some informed perspective even on the things I can't change, the time and energy spent thinking about them only increases. If you conscientiously engage with all the bad news, you risk becoming someone who spends most of their life thinking about bad news, worrying about it. Some people have spent their entire lives worrying, from birth to death, worrying about everything. I actually think there are people living like that. People might laugh and say, "Surely not you?" but if I'm not careful, I could easily become that kind of person myself. No really, it's true. To varying degrees, we're all at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we able to live through today and tomorrow in a world full of such terrible things? I wonder about this sometimes, but I think it's probably because even when the world is drowning in bad news, there are still moments of relief, heartening examples of human kindness, adorable people and creatures, beautiful things, scattered here and there like stepping stones. We still have time to hop from stone to stone, the ones that poke up above the dark waters of bad news. And maybe those stepping stones, even if their total surface area is small, keep stubbornly appearing, one after another. Perhaps that's what we believe. If everyone truly started believing that "human kindness doesn't exist anywhere," then human kindness really would have no place left to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for visiting Hobonichi today. I'm sure since ancient times, most of the news has always been bad.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay reflects on how we survive in a world dominated by bad news by finding and moving between scattered moments of relief, kindness, and beauty—like stepping stones above dark water—whose continued existence depends on our belief in them.</summary>

    <title>Something that passes by the side of "pure language."</title>
    <updated>2026-02-20T06:09:17.714864+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Shigesato Itoi</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I did something unusual: I ended my piece in a way that clearly signaled, "I'll continue this tomorrow." (First, let me recap what I wrote yesterday.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an era when people wrote in classical literary style, but this became too restrictive for expressing various things, so a new style emerged called genbun'itchi, which incorporated spoken language and moved closer to everyday reality. Then, once genbun'itchi became standard, a copywriter named Tsuchiya Koichi half-jokingly coined the term genbun'issho. My guess is that this style probably came from television commercial narration scripts. Because it's closer than anything to the language of everyday life, you could say it's accessible and easy to read for anyone. It's also easier to convey what you want to say, and easier for people to understand. But either way, these are all matters of literary style. In other words, people who aren't particularly interested in writing or reading don't want to read any of it. There are plenty of people for whom using language as a tool to represent the world just doesn't suit them. And besides, what can be expressed through language is, at the end of the day, only a fraction of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Now for a sudden turn.) But people who don't want to read books or essays will read manga, will watch anime, and will dive to considerable depths with those forms of expression. Even in page-turning, panel-by-panel manga, there are words written. There are quite long passages, and they say complex things. "But you'll read that," I think, finding it curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I'm thinking about how language has changed, from classical style to genbun'itchi, from written language to spoken language, it's as if manga has been passing by on a parallel track. Academic papers written in words, poetry, even "silence"! Couldn't all of these be expressed through manga? Even if it's difficult for an individual, you could form a team like in film production. (Not that I'm positioning this against written work.) The tremendous expressive possibilities of manga still have so much room to expand. I want to think about "methods" that don't remain within "pure language" alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. Though here I am writing about all this in "words" again today.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay traces the evolution of Japanese literary style from classical writing to conversational forms, then observes that manga—which combines words and images—offers even greater expressive possibilities than pure written language, reaching audiences who might otherwise avoid traditional text.</summary>

    <title>On the unification of spoken and written language.</title>
    <updated>2026-02-19T06:16:54.431182+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, when people wrote, they wrote in the "classical literary style." I sometimes wonder what I would have done if I'd been born in that era. Of course, even in the days of the classical literary style, people going about their daily lives were still speaking, so there were forms of expression that captured spoken language. Storytelling and rakugo, for instance, are primarily made up of "dialogue."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The style I'm using to write this right now began in a certain era and is written in what's called "genbun itchō-tai," or "speech-writing together style." This term was coined by Koichi Tsuchiya, a greatly admired senior of mine, around the time I was becoming a copywriter. It was, of course, a parody of Futabatei Shimei's "genbun itchi-tai" (the unification of spoken and written language), the Meiji-era novelist and translator's concept, and it was both a joke and deadly serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here's the thing: Tsuchiya only used the phrase "speech-writing together style" in a short essay. He didn't advocate for it widely, so I may have been the only one who read it and took it to heart. The way I felt at the time was that the "unification of spoken and written language" we learned about in textbooks was, when all was said and done, still just "written language." It wasn't the classical literary style, sure, but it was still a "style for writing," and I thought, why not move it closer to "spoken language"? That's when Koichi Tsuchiya's "speech-writing together style" appeared before me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this period, styles like Juzo Itami's work and Rokusuke Ei's "ききがき" (transcribed oral narratives) were also emerging, and written text was leaning toward "spoken language." I suspect that Tsuchiya's "speech-writing together style" may have originated from the style of "live TV commercial scripts," but I can't ask him about it anymore, so I'll never know for sure. Either way, it was a wonderfully versatile style that could incorporate the "pauses" of spoken language while also conveying meaning in the form of written language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, I actually wanted to talk about what comes next, but I've run out of time... I'll continue tomorrow, probably. Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. Though, what you're reading right now is, in fact, also "written language."&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of writing something like that. I've been inspired. By a piece Okuno wrote in the "Hobonichi 3-Minute Column," which I always read. His writing had that kind of explosive power. I've wanted to write something like that for ages. But I don't remember ever actually writing it. I truly want to write something like that, and yet haven't I failed to do so all this time? Despite writing for Hobonichi every single day, I've lived my life this long without writing it, how shameful. And then my junior colleague Okuno went and casually pulled it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was apparently based on a true story. A tale that emerged from somewhere close to Okuno's usual interests. The first half is written in an intellectual style, more tense than usual. He recounts stumbling upon a photo exhibition. The quiet of the gallery, and one other person there, an elderly gentleman. And then. Incredibly, the tension reaches its peak and explodes. I won't say what happens next. It doesn't just end with afterglow following the climax. The narrative moves on to yet another photo exhibition. A 2013 photo exhibit held in a depopulated village. How much more will the reader be swept along? There's a swirling of images that makes your inner ear go funny, and I found myself engaging with Okuno's discussion of art, looking up at the ceiling thinking what a good time I'd had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write that too. Anything will do, now is the time to write it. After Okuno's wonderful piece, not that I'm trying to compete, but what kind of attempt could I possibly manage? Oh well, I'll put on display here a sentence that has neither sound nor scent, that isn't even really one, and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have done that before" may be factually true, but it's not really the truth. I must have done it many, many more times than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. "Toyotomi Brothers!" is fun. "Berabo" is nostalgic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Why walk just for the sake of walking?</title>
    <updated>2026-02-17T06:12:39.952688+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our dog Buiko is now seven years old. She's disliked walks ever since she was a puppy. We'd pull her on her leash, carry her in our arms, and for a while we even tried putting her in a baby stroller. These days we use a mix of carrying and pulling, with a route where she walks the parts she'll walk, especially on the way home. Our previous dog, Bouillon, was the same breed, but he loved walks to excess and would happily trek the distance of three subway stops. When we'd get close to home on the return trip, he'd try to take detours, pulling hard in completely different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say it's strange for a dog to dislike walks. I used to think so too, but the truth is, it's not so much that she dislikes walks as that she's "not fond of walks." In the morning and evening, when we put on her collar and leash and head out the door, she seems rather eager, even happy. But she doesn't like the actual walking. She doesn't want to walk. When she spots another dog up ahead, she'll dash over happily. And if someone calls her cute, she'll approach them wagging her tail and putting on the charm. It's not that her legs are bad or that she lacks stamina, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, on a whim, I asked our "neighbor (ChatGPT)" about Buiko's walk aversion, not really expecting much of an answer. But it came back with something I'd never considered before. In Buiko's case, maybe she doesn't like "movement without purpose"? Jack Russells tend to like doing something, and find just walking boring, it said. Come to think of it, she's very enthusiastic about things like sniffing around, approaching other dogs, and playing chase at "kindergarten," all activities where she's "doing something." In other words, "Why do I have to just walk for no reason?" She never had any motivation for walking itself. Well, it's just one hypothesis, but it oddly made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. Even for humans, "walking" is a relatively new "concept," isn't it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>I went to see Punch, the baby monkey.</title>
    <updated>2026-02-16T06:44:53.744144+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to see a little monkey at the Ichikawa City Zoo. He's a male Japanese macaque, about six months old since birth, with the rather tough-sounding name "Punch." Born last summer, he was rejected by his mother and has been raised by the zookeepers through artificial rearing. They've been gradually working on socializing him so he could rejoin the troop, and he officially joined everyone on Monkey Mountain on January 19th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine cases like this have happened before, but there was something about this particular "Punch" that caught people's attention. When he joined the troop on Monkey Mountain, he brought along an "orangutan stuffed animal" that had been like a surrogate mother to him during his artificial rearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stuffed animal isn't a robot, so it doesn't move. But Punch holds his mother's hand, and as the child, he's the one leading her around. Still, a mother is a mother, so he clings to her for comfort and sleeps in her embrace. He hasn't completely integrated with the other monkeys in the troop yet, but little by little they're playing with him and looking after him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone visiting Monkey Mountain was moved by the sight and took a photo of "the baby monkey with an orangutan," posting it on social media. That became the beginning of something. Perhaps the image of this little monkey, who started life under difficult circumstances with artificial rearing, bravely working his way into monkey society looked to everyone like "hope" itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support hashtag "#GanbareePunch" spread, and he's rapidly becoming a nationwide sensation. On the Sunday I went as a "Punch supporter," the zoo apparently experienced "unprecedented crowds." Families came in droves to the outskirts of Ichikawa in Chiba Prefecture. It's been just six months since his birth on July 26th. A story that's only half a year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, as little Punch grows bigger, he'll probably part ways with his stuffed mother and become hard to distinguish among the monkey troop. That will be one kind of happy ending, I suppose. But for now, the little monkey's story looks like it will continue a while longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. I suppose everyone wants to find "a small story of hope."&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>As a man who was once called President Anko.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love anko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could call it sweetened, simmered azuki beans, but anko doesn't end with just boiling the beans. After simmering them, you heat them in a pot with good thermal conductivity (a tin vessel called a sawari), practically searing them to drive off the moisture. In this process, the sugar approaches the edge of burning and undergoes a kind of "light caramelization" that makes it delicious. You mustn't actually burn it, just get it to that sticky consistency. When I start talking about anko, which I love, I tend to become annoyingly persistent, to the point where people listening to me get fed up. I'm aware of this. Even I think it's not good to be so fundamentalist about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, anko isn't necessarily made from azuki beans. You can use all kinds of beans as ingredients, and they're all delicious. Uguisu an, white an, chestnut an, they're all good. Depending on the situation, even red rice (sticky rice) cooked sweet can be used as the "an" filling in a manju, and it's tasty. What's more, though it contradicts what I just said, I don't actually dislike anko that's simply been sweetened and simmered at all, nor zenzai or shiruko. I actually like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the country, depending on the region and the shop, there are all kinds of anko, and they're generally delicious. There are times when I think "I like this one" or "that one's nice," but really, aside from the ones that are actually bad, they're all good. I'm not saying it has to be this way or that way is no good. Hobbies that head toward "obsession" eventually make a U-turn somewhere and land on the broad plain of "tolerance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very rarely, there's something that makes me think, "Well, this is a bit..." But in those cases, it's the outer wrapping or something other than the anko that's the problem. Anko fundamentally cannot be made carelessly. The ingredients are just beans and sugar, it takes time, and you can't cut corners. Even if you lack the motivation, you can just buy from an anko supplier. Professional anko factories ensure an average level of deliciousness. I love anko, and I'm a fan of all anko equally. At some point, I reached this kind of "good resignation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. I predict that one day it will be recognized abroad as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

We decided to start by putting out a call for members. I've also been telling various people individually, here and there, "We're starting this new thing." Each person had their own response, and reading them was a pleasure. What I appreciated most was that no one asked those press conference-style questions like "What exactly are you going to do?" We've created this new space within Hobonichi and talked plenty about the Manga Club, but we haven't written anything about what kind of business this will be. First, we're gathering members for the Manga Club. That comes before anything else. Everyone gets that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't know what you'll find on an expedition, that's why it's an expedition. When the expedition team sets out, that's when the expedition begins. These are the kinds of thoughts I'm having now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Already knowing too much" is the worst thing. Researching too much, thinking too much, asking too much, covering all the bases, I've been careful about all of that as we've moved forward with the Hobonichi Manga Club. Who wants to do something where everything is already anticipated? We're not looking to be praised for being clever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very first day, we've gotten a flood of applications, not just from my friends and acquaintances, but from people who visit Hobonichi. How interesting this is, how exciting. When we started Hobonichi, there was nothing else like it, and this feels similar somehow. Still, the thrill of a new beginning, that pounding in your chest, depending on how you experience it, can feel more like an ache. No matter how old you get, there's that tension like standing under a waterfall. Well, this is what keeps everyone going, you know. I'm putting on a brave face here, but honestly, we're moving forward while holding on to our weaknesses and our foolishness too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. There's actually something joyful about saying, this is who we are right now, nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The imagination to think "I can't imagine it, but it's amazing."</title>

"Suddenly coming to" in some scene or other. That would be alarming, with no mental preparation, not knowing what's what or what you should do. Even if you were alone in a desert, or placed on a prince's white horse, you feel like you could somehow come up with your next move, but this would be trouble. Here it is: "You're in the middle of sliding down a ski jump." What am I supposed to do? I can't even fall to stop myself. I'm sliding down a 31-degree slope at what I'm told is 120 kilometers per hour. I couldn't possibly make a judgment about whether to fall or keep sliding. That would be trouble, wouldn't it? That's what I'm thinking as I watch the Milan-Cortina Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many events where you're spinning in the air while falling, or careening down bumpy steep slopes. The thing is, I can't connect any of this to my own experiences. I remember skiing a little as a kid. I've tumbled around in the snow. But who on earth has ever rotated in mid-air? Even if someone told me to rotate in the air, I don't think I could do it. If you've driven 100 kilometers per hour on the highway, you can imagine an F1 race at 300 kilometers per hour and think, "I can't really picture it, but it must be incredible." But strapping a board to your feet and spinning multiple times in the air? I can't even get to "I can't picture it, but..." And besides, everyone, listen. Those 1440s and such that we're watching on the broadcast? We're watching them almost entirely in slow motion! If you watched them at regular speed, you wouldn't know what happened, would you? We're going "Whoa!" and "So scary!" but really we're just impressed while thinking "What just happened?" They're using equipment, and they've got help from the snow and ice, but what humans can do has reached a point beyond human understanding. It's gone this far, hasn't it? (This must be true outside of sports as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming to Hobonichi today. Everything becomes specialized to the point of incomprehensibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay reflects on how Winter Olympic sports have become so extreme and specialized that they're completely disconnected from ordinary human experience, advancing to a level "beyond human understanding" where even watching in slow motion barely helps us comprehend what's happening.</summary>

    <title>7777 is also a common number.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, whenever I see a four-digit number starting with 1, I can't help wanting to divide it by 360. Who knew the Olympics would affect me in such a strange way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers don't actually exist, you know. I mean, I sound like a drunk person rambling, but while there are three apples or five bananas, there's no such thing as "3" or "5" itself. They're just concepts we've agreed to treat as real. Numbers can be generated endlessly, you can add and subtract and multiply and divide them, process them however you like. They're useful concepts in all sorts of ways, but because people have been using them for so long, they've taken on all kinds of personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7777, or 3333, or 1111, these are like the rock stars of the number world. Change just one digit to 7776 and suddenly it's not a star anymore. Numbers like 9837 or 5746 or 3895 or 7658 might seem ordinary and unremarkable, but really they're the same as 7777 or 3333 or 1111. Even numbers like 2983 or 1187, if you give them a reading like "meat shop" or "good flowers," they may look plain but they get assigned a role. Well, 1101 is dressed up in the costume of "Itoi" too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know, it's not just numbers. There are supposedly 8.2 or 8.3 billion people in the world, but fundamentally speaking, we're all the same if you think about it. Though you could also say we're all different. But as "humans," the materials we're made of, the way we're made, it's all the same. Maybe it's the way we're raised, the way we live, that isn't the same. There are people like 777777, and people like 33333333, but basically everyone starts out as just a simple 1, and when we die we all become indistinguishable bones anyway. 8.3 billion versions of "me," each one the same "human being."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming to Hobonichi again today. Sorry, thinking about stuff like this has kind of become a hobby of mine lately.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay explores how numbers, like people, are fundamentally the same despite appearing different—just as 7777 seems special while 7776 seems ordinary, all 8.3 billion humans share the same basic nature even though society assigns them different values and roles.</summary>

    <title>The child as the "inner person" of the adult.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's an internet slang term, "the person inside." I always thought it was a strangely apt way of putting things. I feel like you don't hear it as much anymore, but it suddenly occurred to me: the person inside an adult is a child. Adults are adults, sure, but there's also a child inside them, and while they adopt adult attitudes and ways of speaking, they're also trying to satisfy themselves as that child. I'm not saying this is good or bad. If you can sense that child "inside" yourself, if you can feel "oh, there they are," well, that probably means you're pretty adult after all. You don't want to make the child inside cry. But you also can't just let that child run wild. That's what I've been thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, I've made a habit, for quite some time now, of thinking of just about everyone as "that kid I saw in a middle school classroom." Whether it's some distinguished professor or a big star, every human being has gone through their middle school years. What kind of face did they make back then as a junior high kid? What did the other students think of them? How did they spend their time? Even without thinking too deeply about it, can't you kind of see it? Of course I'm sometimes right and sometimes wrong, but if you think of most people's true form as a middle schooler (and I'm just a middle schooler myself, after all), you can see them on incredibly level terms. Most of the time, I think, "Oh yeah, there was someone just like this!" I'm well aware that people attach and subtract various things from there to build up their personality or character or what have you. But no matter how much they pile on or exaggerate, the basis is usually "that kid I saw in the middle school classroom." And, though this feels like adding an unnecessary tail to the thought, there are also adults and old people as the person inside a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming to Hobonichi again today. The development of early childhood education and childcare is necessary for adults too.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Because we're alive, we have memories.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really is true that "to be alive is to make memories." As long as you're living, you can make memories. To put it the other way around, it sounds rather blunt, but "if you're not alive, you can't make memories." Of course, not all memories are pleasant ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People talk about the follies of youth, or how being young means being foolish, and especially when it comes to memories from our younger days, there are things that would be impossible for us now. Some people might say, "That doesn't apply to me," but for me, it does. I don't know if I have many or few, but there are embarrassing things. If the person I was back then were standing in front of me now, there are things I'd want to sit him down and lecture him about at length. But I suspect that even if the present me tried to reason with him, the me of those days wouldn't understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things you do while even slightly thinking "this is wrong," since that feeling is there from the start, you can put the brakes on. Or even when you're just "getting carried away," since deep down you have some awareness of it, even if you're rebellious for a while, it'll settle down eventually. If there was a fundamentally mistaken idea, and both society and yourself were steeped in that mistake, then those are the kinds of things you might reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more troubling is when you're convinced that you're thinking the right thing, that you're doing the right thing, and you look down on people who aren't, or attack people whose ideas don't align with yours. Since you're right, anyone who gets in your way must be either bad or backward, you decide. While you're alive, whether you like it or not, you make memories like that too. It's better not to forget those kinds of memories. Depending on how the lines twist in a simple lottery game, just about any possibility exists. You need to know that. Because to be alive is, well, to have memories piling up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. I hope there's plenty of blank space between one memory and the next.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay reflects on how living means continuously creating memories, and warns that the most troubling mistakes come not from knowing we're wrong, but from being completely convinced we're right while judging or attacking others—memories we should remember as reminders of how easily any of us can fall into that trap.</summary>

    <title>Most of the universe is something other than language.</title>
    <updated>2026-02-09T06:47:44.423036+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's this way of thinking about Earth's history: if you imagine it as a 24-hour clock, Homo sapiens, our human ancestors, don't appear until around 23:59:56. It's dizzying to think about, but we can't help picturing a timeline in our heads where the Nara period was long ago, the pyramids were built even further back, humanity emerged in some unimaginably distant past before that, and dinosaurs roamed in an even more remote antiquity. We imagine a timeline we can survey and comprehend. But really, "these things aren't even comparable!" We use poetic expressions like "as many as the stars," but the number of stars visible to the naked eye isn't actually all that many, is it? There's that saying, "The sands on the beach may run out, but thieves will never disappear from this world," which is meant to suggest an uncountable multitude. But if you think about it calmly, it doesn't seem like such a big deal. You could count the grains of sand on a beach if you really tried hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking along these lines for a while now, but recently I found myself wondering: how many words exist in the entire universe (or at least on Earth)? Not systematic "languages" like Japanese or Greek, but "vocabulary," all the individual words added up like grains of sand. I was playing around with this idea, consulting an AI. Even with the limited counting method of dictionary entries, each language has hundreds of thousands of words, and there are apparently around 7,000 languages, so we're talking tens of millions of words, maybe even 100 or 200 million, the AI told me. And since new words can be created at any time, the number is essentially infinite. It's very much an "aren't there so many!" kind of answer, even from the AI's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that Earth clock analogy made me realize something. However many hundreds of millions of words there might be, the total number of words that have existed since humans were born is nothing! (I'm channeling Kuroita Goro here.) The "actual things and phenomena" that haven't been turned into words, both artificial and natural, vastly outnumber the words themselves. Language, no matter how far it goes, can never reach "reality." It can only sketch a tiny portion with a limited set of paints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is just me playing with words too, I suppose. Thank you for visiting Hobonichi today. Don't be so proud, humanity. Don't be so proud, language.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay uses the vastness of Earth's history as an analogy to argue that despite containing hundreds of millions of words across all languages, human vocabulary can only capture a tiny fraction of actual reality, revealing the fundamental limitations of language itself.</summary>

Now, someone might say, "No, they do move when ordered," and sure, I know that happens. There was even a time when society as a whole operated more on orders. In old dramas, you'd often see scenes where someone would ask, "Is that an order?" and get the reply, "Yes, this is an order." In other words, scenes depicting a kind of "military discipline" where you obey an order even when it goes against your will. Such situations haven't disappeared entirely. But they've decreased tremendously. Fundamentally, truly, people don't move because of orders. It's better to think that way. Whether it's about yourself or about others, I think believing that "people don't move because of orders" helps create a better environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If orders don't move people, what does? There's no single answer. People move for things they like. If there's something they want, they move for that. They'll move for something they believe in or someone they love. They'll move for their own sense of virtue or ethics. Things like that. And beyond that, while not orders exactly, people might move because of violence. They move because everyone else is doing it, swept along by the current. Whether directly or indirectly, they move when threatened. They move to escape from something. They move quite readily out of competitive spirit with others. They might even move under something like hypnosis. And so on. There are really all kinds of reasons people move. Why do I move? When do I try to move? What do I move for? People don't move because of orders, but what does make them move? It's not a quiz, but it's worth thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>While people may occasionally respond to orders, they are fundamentally motivated by their own desires, beliefs, relationships, fears, and values rather than by commands from others. Understanding what truly drives human action—whether in ourselves or others—is essential for creating better environments and relationships.</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Every day, eating their meals, drinking water, getting their teeth brushed a little, pawing at their bedding to make it just right before lying down to sleep. We love that dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading off to school with their backpack, listening to the teacher's lessons with a mix of earnestness and boredom, eating lunch, playing, and coming home again. We adore that elementary school kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laughing at something, crying over something, sometimes getting angry about something, rooting for something, quietly absorbed in their work. We help each other out, all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completely aged now, more wrinkles too, complaining about this ache or that itch, no longer particularly lovely or cool. Sometimes I look at my parent and think, they're just like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether someone is somebody or nobody, whether they're good at their job or not, whether they're deep in thought or spacing out, it's nobody's business to criticize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone on the train, everyone waiting at the traffic light, even, for that matter, everyone who dislikes me. You still mustn't make fun of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying you have to like them, but first of all, you mustn't make fun of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People really aren't listening.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking through Shibuya, I thought I saw the words "Mountain Gorilla." I kept walking without bothering to confirm, but it stayed on my mind. Was it a shop name? A brand? Either way, pretty much every naming possibility has been used up by now...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to me, as an afterthought, that "Mountain Gorilla" literally means "gorilla from the mountains." Which would mean there are gorillas that aren't from the mountains. So instead of mountains, they'd be from... the lowlands? "Lowland Gorilla"? Lowland... wait. Lowland, as in... "Lowland Gorilla"! I already knew that name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd heard of Mountain Gorillas and Lowland Gorillas before, but I'd never actually thought about how those names indicated their habitat, or rather, their taxonomic classification. They were properly introducing themselves all along, "I'm a mountain gorilla," "I'm a lowland gorilla," and I just wasn't listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, the same goes for people's names. Parents pour their hopes and wishes into the names they give their children, but don't we all just ignore that? Whether it's Yoshiko or Kimi or Sho or Kenichi or Tetsu or Yasuhiro, people introduce themselves by their names. But the person hearing it doesn't really take it seriously, do they? They're not listening to the deep themes embedded in those names. They just treat "Yoshiko" or "Tetsu" like labels. But really, those names carry messages: "Beauty," "Philosophy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's not just names. People really don't listen to things, do they? Maybe if we actually took everything seriously and thought about it all, our days would become unbearably full of questions. Like when you're about to have a snack and someone pipes up: "They call it shortcake, but short compared to what? Have you ever seen a long cake anywhere?" That kind of person gets annoying fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I have to say, I'm pretty much always thinking along those annoying lines myself. I just don't say it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming to Hobonichi today. If it's annoying people talking to each other, I guess there's no problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay explores how we mindlessly treat names and words as mere labels without considering their literal meanings or the intentions behind them, though the author acknowledges that constantly questioning everything would be exhausting and annoying.</summary>

    <title>Even the present will eventually become the past.</title>

People tend to think this way. I'm one of those people, so I catch myself thinking it too. When I look back, there really were a lot of good things, weren't there? And maybe that's true, but those "old days" that are supposed to have been so good don't exist anymore. Even if remnants remain, the old days are gone precisely because they're now absent. All we can do is create "something like those good old days." Patching together or reheating whatever's left to make "something like those good old days" is expensive. Still, if everyone decides it's better to have it, or if enough people want it, then "something like the old days" can somehow be made. Being able to create something that people call "good" is certainly a fine thing, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But isn't thinking "things were better in the old days" about everything just having too little expectation for "now"? It's true that every day, constantly, unwelcome news about the "now" comes flying at us. Plenty of people talk about how "now" is only getting worse. They say the current situation is more terrible than ever before, but when I really think about it, as far as I know, every era has always been described that way. Even if you pull out timelines of world history, there probably isn't a single era where people said "now is really great." So naturally, the "old days" that we somehow managed to get through start to seem like they were good. Of course, I have those feelings inside me too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know, if that's how it is, then what about children who've only just been born recently? Are they supposed to live from a "now" with nothing good in it into a "future" that only gets worse? I don't think that's quite right either. We have to look carefully at the "now" that actually exists here and search for hope in the "future" ahead. As adults who've been alive since way back in the "old days," that's our job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. May you have the good fortune of shelter from rain and wind and heat and cold, a full belly, and light.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay argues that while nostalgia for "the old days" is natural, every era has felt troubled to those living through it, so adults have a responsibility to find hope in the present and future rather than teaching children that everything is only getting worse.</summary>

    <title>There is such a thing as "the heart," isn't there.</title>
    <updated>2026-02-04T05:38:50.295913+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a child, I've thought about it a little, or not thought about it at all, or thought about it seriously, or no wait, completely forgotten about it, or if I'm honest, held it very dear, or coldly dismissed it as something that might not even exist. I'm talking about the "heart," or the "mind," or whatever you want to call that thing inside us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you asked someone to show you where the heart is, they might place their hand over their chest, near the physical heart. Others would point to their head and say it's the brain inside the skull. But even if you pressed them further and asked if that's really where it is, they probably couldn't answer with any real confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our ordinary daily lives, we don't consciously think about the existence of air, yet air is there. In the same way, we live believing that the heart exists. To say that there's no such thing as the heart would, conversely, make everything impossible to explain. Because when a person dies, it's clear that their heart disappears too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we're alive, well, it's not quite "I think, therefore I am," but the heart is always thinking something. The heart is what wrote these lines I'm writing now, and it's your heart that has been reading them. I wrote them because I'm alive, and you read them because you're alive. An exchange of hearts happened here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can't show the heart itself, but we can show the traces of the heart's movements in all sorts of ways. Even a smiling face is a manifestation of the heart's movement. The words we speak, the words we write, paintings, calligraphy, dance, song, running, walking – all of these are expressions and traces of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, the act of writing, the act of dancing, the act of singing can set the heart in motion. There are things that wound the heart, and there must be things that invigorate it. Sometimes the heart wants to soak in a hot spring too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. Artificial intelligence keeps evolving, but what will happen to the heart?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>This essay reflects on the elusive nature of the "heart" or inner self—something we can't physically locate or prove exists, yet which reveals itself through all our actions, expressions, and human exchanges. The author concludes by questioning what will become of this invisible but essential human quality in an age of advancing artificial intelligence.</summary>

    <title>My eyes are sleepy. The movie "Fabrication."</title>

That's what I think as I sit down at the keyboard, but I'm so sleepy. Though sleepiness comes in all different varieties, you know. I sometimes put it this way: rather than being sleepy overall, right now it's my "eyes that are sleepy." Being awake isn't hard, I'm full of energy to work! But since my "eyes are sleepy," I'd like to rest them if I could. To rest them, I figure I should close them. Maybe I'll close my eyes. It's only my eyes that are sleepy, after all. Just my eyes. If I'm going to close my eyes, it seems like it would be more convenient to lie down rather than stay sitting in this chair. I don't intend to sleep. I just want to close them to rest my eyes. That happens a lot, you know. And sometimes I actually do lie down on the sofa and close my eyes. Then, why is this? Even though I wasn't sleepy, I fall asleep. My "eyes were sleepy," that's all it was supposed to be, and yet I fall asleep. (Thus concludes this story for now. I was trying to write about something utterly inconsequential, but before I could write about something utterly inconsequential, I fell asleep.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my "eyes are still sleepy," and I think the reason is that last night, after I'd decided to go to bed, I started watching a movie. I started watching just the beginning of "Fabricated: The Man Called a Murderous Teacher," but I couldn't stop anywhere along the way and ended up watching the whole thing. I mean, the title itself is a "spoiler," isn't it? A film with an intense performance by Ayano Go, a fierce performance by Shibasaki Kou, and a superb supporting performance by Kobayashi Kaoru. The story of a man called a murderous teacher because of "fabrications." You practically know the whole plot without even watching it, don't you? But once I started watching, I became so frustrated, and got dragged into the quagmire along with the protagonist, and became so at a loss for what to do that I couldn't stop. But look, you know how it ends, right? He's able to clear his name. You want to see that outcome, even as you spend all that time feeling frustrated. It's a movie based on a true story, and honestly, it makes you grind your teeth. "Fabrications," when wielded by those with power, are terrifying, you know. Thanks for visiting Hobonichi today. That was me, all worked up at dawn, shouting things like "Yes, Kobayashi Kaoru!"&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay humorously chronicles how the author's plan to write about something "inconsequential" is derailed by sleepy eyes and staying up late to watch an intense movie about fabricated accusations, demonstrating how minor decisions (like "just resting your eyes" or "just starting a movie") can spiral beyond our control.</summary>

    <title>Why is the morning paper here?!</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://adtheriault.github.io/todays-darling/images/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was too scared to tell anyone but my closest friends, but maybe it was last year? I was staying at a hotel, and when I got up late in the morning and went to the bathroom sink to brush my teeth, there was a newspaper sitting there. Huh? Did I put a newspaper here? I thought, and glanced at the front page to check the date. Today's news with today's date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, I just woke up. The newspaper gets delivered outside the door. So how did it get here? Did someone silently come into my room and leave the newspaper in the bathroom? A hotel wouldn't provide such intrusive service. Besides, I had the chain lock on, so no one could get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, did I do it myself? I have no idea what time the morning paper gets delivered to hotel doors, but the possibility that I did it myself was clearly higher than someone coming in. Does that mean I've lost the memory of doing it? Is this that "sleepwalking" thing you always used to see in old cartoons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe there have been times like this mixed into my life all along, these moments I have "no memory of." If there have been many times when I've done things but lived as though I hadn't, that's terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always loved general anesthesia. Time stops partway through "now you're going to sleep," and then I come back to myself with the words "oh, I'm awake." It's mysteriously delightful. During that stretch of time between those two moments, I alone am absent from the world. How fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sleepwalking is troubling and scary. Well, when I looked into it later after calming down, it turned out to be the effect of the sleeping pill I'd taken. Apparently I'd retrieved the newspaper while being led into sleep, and forgotten the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You hear about people who get drunk and lose their memory. I wonder if that's not scary for them because they know the cause?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. Anyway, since that time, I haven't had any more episodes of "no memory."&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The essay explores the unsettling experience of discovering a newspaper in an unexpected place with no memory of putting it there, contrasting the frightening loss of control in sleepwalking with the peaceful erasure of time under anesthesia, ultimately revealing it was caused by a sleeping pill.</summary>
